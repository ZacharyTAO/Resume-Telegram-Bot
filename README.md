Prototype we wont be collecting user responses. what happens is we hardcode out questions that would potentially be asked by employers and we make known of these questions to the people using the telechat bot. then the answers to the questions is also hardcoded out. when we release the prototype the students using it are taking on the role as an employer where they can "ask" questions and get answers back.
